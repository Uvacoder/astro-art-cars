# My first NFT collection will be released soon.

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, and it refers to a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as artwork.

NFT art, specifically, refers to digital artwork that has been tokenized as an NFT. I create these digital artworks using my paintings. The uniqueness and scarcity of the artwork are guaranteed through the blockchain technology that NFTs are built upon.

Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger, is used to record and verify ownership and transaction details of NFTs. This ensures that the ownership and authenticity of the NFT art can be easily traced, and it prevents forgery or duplication. Each NFT has a unique token ID, metadata, and smart contracts that define its characteristics, provenance, and any associated terms or royalties for the artist.

In summary, NFT art is digital artwork that is unique, authenticated using blockchain technology through NFTs.
