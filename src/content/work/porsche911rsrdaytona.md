#### About the car

Brumos Racing's iconic race at the Daytona International Speedway in 1973 featured a Porsche 911 RSR. The team, based in Jacksonville, Florida, was known for its success in sports car racing during that era.

The Porsche 911 RSR was a highly competitive race car built by Porsche for endurance racing. It featured a 2.8-liter flat-six engine producing around 280 horsepower and had a lightweight body designed for aerodynamic efficiency. The car's distinctive wide fenders and aggressive appearance made it a fan favorite.

* Engine: The 911 RSR was equipped with a naturally aspirated 2.8-liter flat-six engine, known as the Type 911/83. It produced around 300 horsepower, which was a significant increase over the road-going Carrera RS.

* Weight Reduction: To improve its performance, the 911 RSR underwent extensive weight-saving measures. The body panels were made of lightweight materials like fiberglass, and the windows were replaced with thinner glass or plexiglass. Interior components were stripped down to reduce weight as well.

* Aerodynamics: The RSR featured an iconic "ducktail" rear spoiler to improve aerodynamics and increase downforce. It also had wider fender flares to accommodate wider wheels and tires.

* Racing Success: The 1973 Porsche 911 RSR had several notable achievements in motorsport. One of its most famous victories came at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1973, where it won its class and finished in the top positions overall. The RSR also competed in other endurance races such as the 12 Hours of Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

* Rarity and Value: Due to its limited production and racing pedigree, the 1973 Porsche 911 RSR is highly coveted among collectors and automotive enthusiasts. Authentic examples are quite rare and can command substantial prices in the classic car market.

The 1973 Porsche 911 RSR remains an iconic representation of Porsche's racing heritage and is celebrated for its performance, distinct styling, and motorsport accomplishments.
